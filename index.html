          I have always had a passion for the tech world. It started when I was
          young, when my dad brought home a Super Nintendo. I would obssesively
          tackle this game system to figure out how to win. It was just so fun!

        <p class="card__text">
          My first experience with code was in the form of figuring out cheats
          in the game "Age of Empires III". Looking through the game files had
          me fascinated with how games actually worked. Now it was not until
          much later that I actually understood what I was looking at.

          Believe it or not, Dungeons & Dragons has fueled my passion for code
          as well. After I learned Python, I wanted to impress my friends by
          making a dice roller app. This app was my first project in programming
          and it was all done on my phone in pass-time.

        <p class="card__text">
          Learning guitar actually taught me how to teach myself. Hours of
          YouTube videos and Google searches, with a lot more of finger grinding
          practice got me the knowledge to play my first song, "Nothing Else
          Matters" by Metallica. These learned principals have carried through
          to present day.
